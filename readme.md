it is a project that aims to provide more possibilities for the tuxedo laptop's rgb keyboard

i'm a beginner but , i love to learn

for now it is a bit in scratch state and keyborad.py needs to have admin rights so for now the best way to run it is by doing : 

sudo python (thefile)

for now it is not a realy stable solution

modes :

0   : only one custom color
1   : rgb rainbow like everyone likes
2   : switching colors without transitions
3   : i'm gona try to put transitions to the 2
function name in the custom.py file

customs functions : 

they are called every time the leds have to refresh and all they need to do is return [r,g,b] values
